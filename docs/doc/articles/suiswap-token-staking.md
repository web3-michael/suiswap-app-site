The Suiswap platform aims to provide multiple benefits to its users, including the opportunity to unlock platform revenue through holding and staking SSWP tokens. In this article, we will explain in detail how SSWP token holders can participate in platform revenue sharing, staking, yield farming, and other related benefits.


## Platform Revenue Sharing

We will collect approximately 60% of the platform's revenue every 14 days and return this portion of the revenue to users as dividends on the 15th day. We call each 14-day period an earning cycle. Earning cycles on the Suiswap mainnet are set to 14 days, meaning that users who stake their SSWP tokens can claim their share of the platform's 60% revenue every two weeks. In testnet, earning cycles are set to one day.

**Users who stake their tokens before the start of the next earning cycle have the right to claim dividends from the current earning cycle, and your share of dividends depends on your staked SSWP amount multiplied by your Boost value (see below).**

> #### Example
>
> For example, if the first earning cycle on the Suiswap mainnet runs from March 1st to March 14th, and the second earning cycle from March 15th to March 28th, approximately 60% of the revenue generated between March 1st and March 14th will be collected. 
>
> At the start of the second earning cycle (March 15th), the dividends from the first earning cycle (March 1st to March 14th) will be distributed to users who staked their tokens on the platform before March 15th. Users who stake their tokens on or after March 15th will not be eligible for dividends from the first earning cycle.
>
> At the start of the third Earning Cycle (March 29th), users who staked their tokens before March 29th can claim dividends from the second Earning Cycle (March 15th to March 28th), and so on.



## Staking

When you stake your SSWP tokens, you can choose your lockup period. During this time, your SSWP tokens will be locked in a smart contract and cannot be withdrawn. Locked tokens can be used for:

1. Claiming platform dividends
2. Yield Farming: Earning additional, stable SSWP rewards after the lockup period ends.

**The longer your lockup period, the higher your share of platform revenue and additional SSWP rewards with higher APR.** Specifically, your lockup period will affect two factors: 

- Boost value 

- Additional SSWP rewards.

  

### Boost Value

Boost acts as an additional multiplier that is used to calculate your share of platform revenue, with values typically ranging from 1.0 to 7.0, depending on the length of your staking period. The longer you stake your tokens, the higher your boost value.

Your dividend reward share will be calculated based on **your staked token amount multiplied by your oost value**. For example, staking 1000 SSWP tokens with a boost value of 2.0 will yield the same dividend rewards as staking 2000 SSWP tokens with a boost value of 1.0.



### Yield Farming

When you stake SSWP tokens on the Suiswap platform, the platform will grant additional SSWP tokens based on your staked amount when you unlock your tokens. This allows you to earn stable, additional rewards simply by staking.

Your additional SSWP rewards depend on your staked amount and staking period. With the same staked SSWP amount, the longer your staking period, the higher your APR, and the more additional SSWP rewards you will receive when unlocking your tokens.

> ##### Note
>
> **Please note that this does not mean the total circulating supply of SSWP will increase over time.** 
>
> Since the total circulating supply of SSWP tokens is fixed upon the launch of Suiswap, a portion of SSWP tokens will be pre-allocated for staking rewards. Once this pre-allocated portion is exhausted, you will no longer receive additional rewards from staking SSWP. However, you can still extend your staking period to increase your Boost value.



## How to Stake

1.  Visit the [Suiswap app](https://suiswap.app/) and navigate to the "Suiswap Token" tab.

2. In the `Suiswap Token` tab, you can view your total SSWP token holdings, their corresponding market value, and the current amount of SSWP tokens you hold and have staked.

3. Click the `Stake` button in the Suiswap Token tab to start staking your SSWP tokens. In the pop-up interaction panel, you can choose the amount of tokens to stake and the staking period.

4. The staking panel will prompt you to select the amount to stake and the lockup period. After selecting the given lockup period, you can see your boost value and the estimated additional SSWP rewards and APR for the current lockup period.

5. After selecting the staking amount and period, click the `Stake` button in the panel to submit a staking request to the smart contract deployed on the blockchain.

6. After completing the request, you will see your staking information under the Suiswap Token tab. You can stake multiple times, but since you will stake different SSWP tokens at different times and their lockup periods may vary, each staking action will generate a separate staking information panel, and their dividends and rewards will be calculated separately.

7. You can select one of the staking information panels and click the `Claim Reward` button to claim platform revenue or the `Unlock` button to unlock the staked SSWP.

8. When you select `Claim Reward`, a claim-reward" interaction panel will pop up, listing your dividend earnings for each liquidity pool during the current earning cycle.

9. Click the `Claim` button to claim all dividend earnings, completing the dividend claim for the current earning cycle.

10. You may encounter situations where the `Claim` button is not clickable, which is primarily due to one of the following reasons:

    - You have already claimed your dividend earnings for the current earning cycle and cannot claim them again. You must wait for the next Earning Cycle.

    - The current earning cycle has not ended, and you must wait for the next earning cycle to begin before you can claim dividends from the previous earning cycle.

In conclusion, staking SSWP tokens on the Suiswap platform allows users to participate in platform revenue sharing and yield farming, providing additional benefits and rewards to SSWP token holders. By carefully selecting your staking period and amount, you can maximize your potential earnings from the Suiswap platform.
