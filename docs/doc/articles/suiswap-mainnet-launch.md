We are thrilled to announce the launch of the Suiswap Mainnet, a major milestone in our journey towards a more efficient and equitable decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Our vision is to provide a platform that leverages the power of SUI to give everyone, everywhere, equal access to financial services and empower the entire SUI ecosystems.

Simultaneously with the mainnet launch, in order to encourage users to provide liquidity for our protocol. we will establish the 

1. [Initial SSWP liquidity pool](#1.-initial-sswp-token-liquidity-pool)
2. [Initial liquidity reward event](/doc/suiswap/?section=suiswap&article=suiswap-initial-liquidity-reward)

You can participate in both activities to maximize your SSWP earnings.

## 1. Initial SSWP Token Liquidity Pool

Upon the launch of the Suiswap Mainnet, we will establish an initial liquidity pool for Suiswap's native token SSWP, namely `SSWP/SUI`, to facilitate a small portion of SSWP token circulation initially. This liquidity will comprise about 1% of the total circulating tokens and will be sold at an initial price of 0.015 SUI per SSWP.

- This pool will first serve as a beacon for determining the price of our IDO public sale. In subsequent IDO events, our selling price will be determined by the price of the `SSWP/SUI` pool.
- At the same time, this portion of SSWP can enable users to experience all SSWP-based features, such as obtaining 60% of the platform dividend by staking SSWP tokens, and earning extra SSWP benefits by locking SSWP. As demonstrated in our test network, any user who purchases SSWP tokens via `SSWP/SUI` and completes the staking after the mainnet launch can receive 60% of the platform income dividend on the 14th day after the mainnet launch.

The `SSWP/SUI` liquidity pool adopts an automatic destruction mechanism. One-sixth of the transaction fee will be used to automatically purchase `SSWP` tokens and destroy them. This will help reduce the token circulation in the long term and stabilize the price of the SSWP token.


## 2. Initial Liquidity Reward Event

We will host an Initial Liquidity Rewards event that will last for two months. Any user who chooses to provide liquidity for more than three months in the **SUI/USDC, SUI/USDT, USDC/USDT** pools can share 400 million SSWP tokens evenly.
