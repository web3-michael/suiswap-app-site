## IDO Rebate

We offer SSWP rebates for Level 1 and Level 2 users.

The rebate will be conducted simultaneously with the airdrop and will not affect the airdrop allocation.

## IDO Magic Potion

Any Discord member participating in our IDO (regardless of user level and purchase amount) and successfully linking our wallet using the `/link-address` command to participate in the IDO project (otherwise, we cannot find you through on-chain data) will receive our IDO Magic Potion .

IDO Magic Potion will grant you an additional 1000 Suiswap points and multiply the total Suiswap points for users with more than 5000 points by 1.5.

For example, this means a user with 10,000 Suiswap points will receive (10,000 + 1,000) * 1.5 = 16,500 Suiswap points.
