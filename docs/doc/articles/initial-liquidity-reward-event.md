Any user who chooses to provide liquidity for over three months in the **SUI/USDC, SUI/USDT, and USDC/USDT** pools can **share 400,000,000 SSWP tokens**.

**This event will last for two months**, during which we will track all user transactions within this period and select those who provide liquidity with a lock-up duration of over three months as our reward recipients.

All rewards will be distributed **after the event ends**, and we will officially commence long-term liquidity mining following the conclusion of this event.



## Reward rules for the event:

1. 12,500,000 SSWP tokens will be distributed among the first 10,000 users who provide a liquidity value of more than \$100.

2. 12,500,000 SSWP tokens will be distributed among the first 2,000 users who provide a liquidity value of more than \$500.

3. 12,500,000 SSWP tokens will be distributed among the first 100 users who provide a liquidity value of more than \$10,000.

4. 25,000,000 SSWP tokens will be equally distributed among users who provide a liquidity value of more than \$100 (throughout the event).

5. The remaining 337,500,000 million tokens will be distributed based on a weighted allocation of your liquidity value and lock-up duration.



## Participation rules for the event:

1. You need to provide liquidity in the **SUI/USDC, SUI/USDT, and USDC/USDT** pools on the Suiswap mainnet.
2. **Your liquidity provision lock-up time must exceed 3 months.**



## FAQ

###### 1. Does participating in this event mean I spend this amount of money to get rewards?

Of course not.

You can withdraw your liquidity amount after the lock-up period. At the same time, since you are providing liquidity for all transactions on the Suiswap platform, you can receive liquidity rewards (i.e., a 0.25% transaction fee for each trade, but beware of [impermanent loss](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained) caused by price changes).

Specifically, by providing liquidity for three months or more, you can receive after the lock-up period:

1. Withdraw your tokens (the ratio of the two will change with price fluctuations).
2. The profits you made from platform transaction fees during the lock-up period.
3. **SSWP tokens from this event**.

----------------------------------

###### 2. Can I receive rewards from Events 1 to 5 simultaneously?

Yes, since the statistical methods for each event are different. You can receive rewards for Events 1 to 4 by providing liquidity only once.

----------------------------------

###### 3. How is my liquidity value calculated?

Your liquidity value depends solely on the value of the tokens when you provide liquidity, and the values of USDC and USDT are both considered to be \$1.0.

For example, if you provided 1,000 SUI tokens and 1,500 USDC when the SUI price was \$1.5, your liquidity value would be equivalent to \$3,000. After the event, if the value of SUI changes to \$1.2, your liquidity value **will not** be recalculated and will still be considered as \$3,000.

----------------------------------

###### 4. How is the time sequence for Events 1, 2, and 3 determined?

In Events 1, 2, and 3, we will sort all users' liquidity-providing transactions in `SUI/USDC`, `SUI/USDT`, and `USDC/USDT` pools by transaction time (according to the blockchain confirmation time) and calculate the time.

----------------------------------

###### 5. Can providing more liquidity value in Event 4 increase the number of tokens I receive?

No, in Event 4, we will distribute this portion of tokens equally among participants. As long as your liquidity value is equal to or greater than \$100, you can share this reward equally.

----------------------------------

###### 6. Is there a minimum liquidity value requirement for participation in Event 5?

There is no minimum liquidity value requirement for Event 5. Any user who provides liquidity to the pool during this period can participate in Event 5. The number of tokens you ultimately receive will depend on your liquidity value and lock-up duration.

----------------------------------

###### 7. Will providing more liquidity value or longer lock-up periods in Event 5 result in more tokens?

Yes, a higher liquidity value or longer lock-up period will increase your final allocation weight.

The specific calculation is the "liquidity value at the time of your provision" multiplied by the corresponding multiplier.

The multiplier depends only on your lock-up duration, as shown in the table below:

| Lock-up Duration | Multiplier |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| 3 Months         | 2          |
| 4 Months         | 3          |
| 6 Months         | 6          |
| 1 Year           | 10         |
| 2 Years          | 20         |
| 3 Years          | 30         |
| 4 Years          | 40         |

For example:

- User 1 provides 1,000 SUI tokens and 1,300 USDC tokens when the SUI price is \$1.3 for the `SUI/USDC` pool. Their liquidity value is \$2,600. User 1 chooses a 1-year lock-up, receiving a 10x boost multiplier. Their final token allocation weight is 2,600 * 10 = 26,000.
- User 2 provides 1,000 SUI tokens and 1,000 USDC tokens when the SUI price is \$1 for the `SUI/USDC` pool. Their liquidity value is \$2,000. User 2 chooses a 3-month lock-up, receiving a 2x boost multiplier. Their final token allocation weight is 2,000 * 2 = 4,000.

This means that in the Event 5 token rewards, User 1 receives approximately 6.5 times more tokens than User 2 (26,000/4,000).

> ##### Note: 
>
> Please distinguish between the multiplier for this event and the "liquidity boost" displayed in the liquidity provision panel. 
>
> Although both are used to multiply the provided liquidity value by a factor for weighted allocation of rewards to incentivize those who provide longer liquidity value duration, their purposes are different:
>
> 1. The former serves only as a coefficient for this event.
> 2. The liquidity boost is a coefficient for liquidity mining after the event ends.
